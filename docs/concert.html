                    people around the world in a tribute to the visionary men 
                    and women who use the power of music to promote the unity 
                    of mankind above the differences that set us apart. Through 
                    the universal language of music, we reaffirm our conviction

                  <strong>Luminoso</strong> for guitar and sampled sounds was 
                  written for Enrique Malo Lop and created in the studios of the 
                  IUA/Phonos Foundation in Barcelona, Spain. It is the third work 
                  in a series of compositions for solo instrument and electronics. 
                  The guitar part combines flamenco and classical guitar techniques 
                  with percussive sonorities played on the body of the instrument. 
                  The electronic part of Luminoso is comprised entirely of acoustic 
                  guitar sounds, some of which are easily identifiable, and others 
                  of which have been processed into completely different forms 
                  using a variety of software tools. &quot;<em>The title refers 
                  to the quality of sunlight in Barcelona, which I found myself 
                  trying to capture in this music.</em>&quot;</p>

                  (1937) was awarded a Fulbright Fellowship to study and work 
                  at Columbia University in New York (1962/65) as assistant to 
                  V. Ussachevsky, M. Davidovsky and E. Varese at the Columbia 
                  Princeton Electronic Music Centre, where he composed his first 
                  electronic pieces. He was also the sound engineer for the Alwyn 
                  Nikolais Ballet. With J.M.Mestres Quadreny he established in 
                  1968 the Barcelona Electronic Music Studio. In 1975 he created 
                  the Phonos Electronic Music Studio with J.M.Mestres Quadreny, 
                  L.Callejo and G,Brncic, which was transformed into the Phonos 
                  Foundation in 1982, of which he is currently the secretary and 
                  executive director. He also teaches at the Escola Superior de 
                  Musica de Catalunya. His compositional work is mainly electroacoustic, 
                  including numerous pieces for instruments and tape, and music 
                  for ballet, theatre, film and video.<br>
                  <br>
                  <strong>Secuencia V</strong> for guitar was created at the request 
                  of guitarist Jordi Codina in order to establish a Spanish contemporary 
                  classic guitar repertory. So I decided to use flamenco elements 
                  for the instrumental section, while on the tape there are percussive 
                  sounds related to the flamenco performance based on percussive 
                  guitar samples. This piece is quite often played in Andalucia 
                  by local guitar players.</p> 
                <p><strong><font color="#CC6633"><a name="Truslove"></a>Graeme 
                  Truslove</font></strong> (1978), composer and guitarist, has 
                  a M.S. in electronics, specialized in music, from Glasgow University 
                  and studied classic guitar. He is mostly interested in aspects 
                  of improvisation using many jazz and Hindu music techniques. 
                  He has given concerts in classical music as well as celtic music 
                  in Scotland, and plays tabla and djembe in an african music 
                  group. In 2001 Truslove was awarded a SGAE-Phonos grant in to 
                  compose the present Piece for guitar and tape, which also received 
                  a grant from the Scottisch Arts Council. </p>
                  <p><strong>Piece for guitar and tape</strong> is an electroacoustic 
                    environment where the guitar player is given the freedom to 
                    colour the underlaying textures through his own improvisation. 
                    In terms of an harmonic representation, the guitar part is 
                    notated as a series of chords as in jazz music, however, the 
                    traditional homophonic notation used in jazz is somewhat misleading 
                    when applied to this piece, as none of the chord changes are 
                    strictly sequential &#8211; nearly all involve an element 
                    of overlap from chord to chord. Throughout the piece, the 
                    individual voices fade in and out, and it is only at the time 
                    when a strong harmonic implication is made that it is notated. 
                    The areas between chords, from the point of view of the improvisation, 
                    can be considered transitional. The score provided shows how 
                    the electronic voices move with respect to the tape position, 
                    and where and how these voices imply the harmony. It can be 
                    seen that the piece commences with two minutes of silence. 
                    This is a period of complete freedom for the guitarist, and 
                    a point where improvisational ideas could be stated before 
                    developing them later in the piece.</p>
                  
                <p><strong><font color="#CC6633"><a name="Humet"></a>Ram&oacute;n 
                  Humet</font></strong> (Barcelona, 1968), composer, pianist and 
                  engineer, studied mainly with Gerry Weil and Harriet Serr. Gerry 
                  supplied him the basis of music theory and the music forms, 
                  as well as a great love for music with no limits. Harriet gave 
                  him a solid base in the art of interpretation and discipline 
                  in study. Both were his contacts while living in Venezuela, 
                  where he established contact with afro-cuban music. In Europe 
                  Humet continued his studies with Jonathan Harvey, George Crumb, 
                  Salvatore Sciarrino, Helmut Lachenmann and Joan Guinjoan. At 
                  present he teaches at the Cambrils City Music School and at 
                  the Barcelona Liceo Conservatory. In 2001 he was awarded an 
                  IUA-Phonos grant in order to create Mantra I. </p>
                  <p><strong>Mantra I</strong> is a result over the meditation 
                    on a fundamental and absolute sound. The sound emerges from 
                    different sound sources: the two bass strings of the guitar, 
                    the electronic sound, the tibetan bell and the voice. Mantra 
                    is not music to listen, or music to understand. Mantra is 
                    music to contemplate.</p>
